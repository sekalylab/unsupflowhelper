# unsupflowhelper v0.1

Unsupflowhelper is a R suite of tools for unsupervised analysis and visualization of flow cytometry data. 

Unsupflowhelper is compatible with other flow cytometry libraries, like flowCore, flowWorkspace, MetaCyto and CytoExploreR.
These tools excel at compensating, setting up gating strategies, or plotting more traditional flow cytometry plots, but are not built for modern unsupervised workflows.

You can install the package in R using 

```install_github("sekalylab/unsupflowhelper")```
